# Extending the Growing Self Organizing Map (GSOM) for Unsupervised Learning-Based Modelling of Hidden Structures and Patterns in Data
___

##
This research aims to expand the capabilities of the Growing Self-Organizing Map (GSOM) by
focusing on its applications in data analytics and knowledge discovery. While GSOM
demonstrates significant scalability and adaptability through controlled growth mechanisms, its
potential for diverse, real-world datasets and comparative advantages, as well as the theoretical
implications of such advantages over traditional SOMs, remain underexplored.
By leveraging GSOMâ€™s dynamic growth feature and incorporating advanced clustering methods
like data skeleton modeling, this study seeks to demonstrate its utility in complex domains, such
as human behavioral analysis and multi-dimensional data representation. The focus is to
evaluate its hierarchical clustering capabilities, demonstrate its adaptability to real-world data,
and benchmark it against conventional methods, with a specific emphasis on topology
preservation.
