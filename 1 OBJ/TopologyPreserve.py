    Implements the C-Measure (CM) as described in the paper (Page 8).
    Purpose: Quantifies overall topological alignment by computing a cost function that sums

    scheme is used, modeling the cost of axonal wiring in cortical mappings.
    A lower CM indicates better topology preservation.

    Parameters:
    - weights: numpy array of shape (N, d), where N is the number of neurons and d is the
      dimensionality of the input space (weight vectors w_i).
    - lattice_positions: numpy array of shape (N, 2), the 2D coordinates of neurons in the map space.

    Returns:

    Assumptions:
    - The paper's minimal wiring scheme uses a binary connectivity function in the input space
      (1 if neighbors, 0 otherwise). Since the paper does not specify how to determine neighbors
      in the input space, we assume Euclidean distances for d_V (common in SOM literature).

    Purpose: Measures the average mismatch between neighborhood structures in the input and

    TP â‰ˆ 0 indicates a good match; TP < 0 suggests the map is too low-dimensional, TP > 0 too high.
